    "Python dataclasses are a relatively new feature introduced in Python 3.7 that provide a way to create classes that are primarily used to store data, with less boilerplate code than regular classes. Dataclasses can be thought of as a way to define classes that are similar to named tuples, but with added functionality and the ability to define methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dataclass, you simply use the `@dataclass` decorator and define the fields that the class should have."
