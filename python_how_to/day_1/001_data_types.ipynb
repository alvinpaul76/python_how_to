In this case, you could return an empty tuple to indicate that there are no values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another situation where an empty tuple can be useful is when you need to define a constant value that cannot be changed. Tuples are immutable in Python, which means that once a tuple is created, its values cannot be changed. If you need a constant value that has no elements, you can define it as an empty tuple."

    "#### What is the purpose of tuples if we cannot amend them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are immutable sequences in Python, which means that once a tuple is created, its values cannot be changed. While this might seem limiting at first, there are several advantages to using tuples in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tuples are faster than lists**: Since tuples are immutable, Python can make certain optimizations that are not possible with mutable objects like lists. For example, when you access an element in a tuple, Python can use a simpler indexing operation, rather than having to check whether the tuple has been modified since it was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tuples are safer than lists**: Because tuples are immutable, you can be sure that the values they contain will not be accidentally modified by your code. This can be especially useful in large programs, where it can be difficult to keep track of all the places where a particular value is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tuples can be used as dictionary keys**: Unlike lists, which cannot be used as dictionary keys, tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries. This is because dictionaries require their keys to be immutable, so that they can be used as a lookup value. Tuples are a natural choice for this, because they are immutable and can be used to represent a unique combination of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tuples can be used for multiple assignments**: When you assign a tuple to a set of variables in Python, the values in the tuple are automatically unpacked and assigned to the variables. This can be a very convenient way to assign multiple values at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tuples can be used as function arguments and return values**: When you call a function in Python, you can pass it a tuple as an argument, and the function can return a tuple as a result. This can be a convenient way to pass multiple values between functions, without having to create a new class or data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, tuples can be a very useful data structure in Python, even though they are immutable. They can be used for a variety of purposes, including storing multiple values, representing complex data structures, and passing data between functions."
